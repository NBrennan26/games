Six classic games in one convenient location

Battleship, Etch-a-Sketch, Memory Card, Picture Search, Rock Paper Scissors, and Tic-Tac-Toe. All six games were made at various times while following the Odin Project curriculum. I just made a React app to compile them into one site so you can play them all more easily.
